# Password Generator

This simple python script generates a password
of random characters of a length specified by the user.

### Why?

I like to generate random passwords for signing up on sites, but sometimes, I feel
like I need a better way to generate passwords so I wrote this simple script
for doing my work.

### How it works?

The script itself is self explanatory.

### Usage

```bash
python password_gen.py <length_of_password>
```

### Example

```bash
python password_gen.py 16 # Output: atT=/i]I*i(j5/cT
```

#### Note

If user doesn't specify the password length, it'll be set to 16 (default password length)
